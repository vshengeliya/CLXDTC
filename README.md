The program should print the numbers 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print “CLX” instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print “DTC”. For numbers that are a multiple of 3 and 5, it should print “CLXDTC”.

To run the function:

* git clone the repo to the local computer
* cd into folder `CLXDTC`
* to run the function in NodeJs, type `node index.js` to see the output in the console
